# cyclecount
Python scripts to automate populating spreadsheets for manual cycle counting.

# Description
This script is used to automate the process of populating a spreadsheet with inventory data to complete manual cycle counts in a warehouse. Before, users had to compare a list of SKUs from spreadsheet 1, to a list of SKUs in spreadsheet 2, then if any match, copy information from spreadsheet 2 to spreadsheet 3. By automating this process, the time it takes to set up spreadsheet 3 is reduced to the time it takes to run the python script. This also reduces the likelihood of typos due to manual data entry.
